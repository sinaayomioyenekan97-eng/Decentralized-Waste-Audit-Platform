# ♻️ Decentralized Waste Audit Platform

Welcome to a revolutionary way to tackle urban waste management! This Web3 project builds a transparent, blockchain-powered platform on Stacks using Clarity smart contracts. Cities, auditors, and waste producers can submit, verify, and report waste audits immutably, while token-based incentives reward measurable reductions in waste—solving real-world issues like opaque reporting, fraud in audits, and lack of motivation for sustainability.

## ✨ Features

🔍 Transparent audit submissions with immutable blockchain records  
📊 Real-time verification of waste data by independent auditors  
💰 Token incentives for cities and producers achieving waste reduction targets  
🏆 NFT certificates for top performers in sustainability  
📈 Analytics dashboard powered by on-chain data queries  
🚫 Anti-fraud mechanisms to prevent duplicate or falsified reports  
🤝 Governance for community-driven updates to incentive rules  
🌍 Scalable for multiple cities with cross-chain compatibility potential  

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Cities/Waste Producers**  
- Register your entity on the platform.  
- Submit waste audit data (e.g., tonnage, types, reduction metrics) via the audit submission contract.  
- Stake tokens to commit to reduction goals—earn rewards if targets are met!  
- Receive NFT certificates for verified achievements.  

**For Auditors**  
- Verify submitted audits against real-world data (integrated via oracles).  
- Stake tokens to participate in verification pools.  
- Earn rewards for accurate validations; face penalties for disputes.  

**For Verifiers/Community**  
- Query on-chain reports to view transparent waste metrics.  
- Participate in governance votes to adjust incentive parameters.  
- Use analytics contracts to generate custom reports on city performance.  

That's it! Blockchain ensures trustless transparency, while incentives drive real reductions in urban waste.

## 📜 Smart Contracts (8 in Total)

This project leverages 8 Clarity smart contracts for modularity, security, and scalability:  

1. **UserRegistry.clar**: Handles registration of cities, producers, and auditors with unique IDs and role-based access. Prevents sybil attacks with proof-of-identity hooks.  

2. **AuditSubmission.clar**: Allows submission of waste audit data (hashes, metrics, timestamps). Ensures data integrity with hash verification and prevents duplicates.  

3. **AuditVerification.clar**: Manages multi-party verification processes. Auditors stake to vote on audit validity; resolves disputes via majority consensus.  

4. **IncentiveToken.clar**: An STX-compatible fungible token (e.g., based on SIP-010) for rewards. Handles minting, burning, and transfers based on reduction achievements.  

5. **RewardDistribution.clar**: Calculates and distributes tokens based on verified waste reduction metrics. Integrates with oracles for external data feeds on targets.  

6. **GovernanceDAO.clar**: Enables token holders to propose and vote on platform changes, like adjusting reward rates or verification thresholds.  

7. **NFTRewards.clar**: Mints non-fungible tokens (SIP-009 compliant) as certificates for top performers. Tracks ownership and metadata for achievements.  

8. **AnalyticsQuery.clar**: Provides read-only functions for querying aggregated data, generating reports, and computing stats like total waste reduced across cities.  

These contracts interact seamlessly—e.g., a successful verification in AuditVerification triggers rewards via RewardDistribution. Deploy them on Stacks for low-cost, Bitcoin-secured operations!
